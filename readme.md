I made this project since I thought it would be a fun way to use graphs in something i needed. I plan for this to be part of EBN a collection of tools for small businesses and people. This software was made in NiceGUI nicegui and sqlite sql as my database. I learned a lot from this project mainly how to use nice gui wich may come in handy if I ever make a project like this but i'll probably stick to flask or fully drop python for my other web dev projects. I also made this in 1 day which is a pretty big achievement for me.
